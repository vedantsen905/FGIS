          <p className="mb-4">
            In 2020, John returned home after a severe storm and discovered pools of water on his kitchen countertop and floor. Upon further investigation, he found that water was leaking through the ceiling light fixture. After investigating the issue, he discovered that a blockage in the roof's drain area had caused water to accumulate, leading to the leak through the butyl membrane and into the ceiling. Luckily, John had taken out a home and contents insurance policy to protect against such events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to his insurance policy, John was covered for the costs of repairing the damage to his property and for replacing his furniture and belongings.
